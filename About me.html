									<h2>My professional introduction</h2>
									<p>I'm Monique Tabet, a senior Mechanical Engineer with a specialization in robotics at Georgia Tech.
										<a class="image main"><img src="images/robojackets group picture.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> My journey into the world of robotics and automation was fueled by a personal initiative to develop my computer science skills, driven by a fascination with the transformative power of automation. Beyond my core mechanical engineering curriculum, I proactively pursued coursework in C++, Java, and MATLAB, recognizing that the fusion of mechanical and computer science expertise is the key to pushing the boundaries of innovation in robotics.

										My quest for growth extends to all aspects of my life. My brain is wired to seek efficiency and optimization, not just in my academic pursuits but also in my personal endeavors. I leverage management tools and strategies to enhance productivity, streamline processes, and maximize results. This holistic approach reflects my commitment to continuous improvement and my readiness to make a lasting impact in the tech industry and beyond.</p>

									<h2>Balancing my gears: My personal recipe of life</h2>
										<p>
											Our world is evolving at warp speed, and it's so easy to feel like you're caught in a whirlwind. But here's my little secret: I've found that life is all about balance. It's about harmonizing the hustle of chasing professional dreams with those serene moments where creativity has room to breathe.

											When I'm not knee-deep in equations and schematics, you'll often find me seeking that balance. I thrive on it. A rewarding workout session? Count me in. A hike through the great outdoors? Absolutely. And let's not forget my not-so-secret love for dance classes – who can resist the temptation of moving to a rhythm that's all their own?

											But it's not all about staying active. Weekends are my sacred downtime. I'm a coffee lover, and there's nothing quite like sipping on a cappuccino while I dive into the pages of a good book. One of my all-time favorites? "Where the Crawdads Sing." It's a literary masterpiece where storytelling and poetry collide in the most enchanting way, and that plot twist? Brace yourself – it's a game-changer. Here is some of my favorite quotes from that book:
											<blockquote>"We're all like giraffes not using their necks to reach the higher leaves." </blockquote>
											 It's a reminder that sometimes, we're sitting on untapped potential. And then there's,
											 <blockquote> "Never underrate the heart, capable of deeds the mind cannot conceive." </blockquote>
												 It's a testament to the incredible power of passion and emotion.

											But here's a little secret about me that not many know: I'm a closet poet. When I'm in a more intimate setting, you'll find me scribbling away, pouring my thoughts and feelings onto the page. It's my way of unraveling the complexities of life and making sense of this fast-paced, ever-evolving world we live in.

											So, there you have it – a glimpse into the quirks and passions that make me who I am. I'm on a journey to bridge the gap between the mechanical and the digital, all while seeking that elusive balance between the chaos and the calm.
